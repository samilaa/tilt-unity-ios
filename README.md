Your goal is to tilt the platform in order for the ball to reach the finish cube, while avoiding various obstacles in the way.

To control, you drag your finger across the screen.

### Features
- Custom levels
- Custom settings
- In-game currency
- Unlockables
- Various obstacles

## Development

### Code
I created Tilt using Unity (2019.2.0f1), using C# as the main programming language.

Scripts are designed to be modular to achieve a high level of scalability as well as flexibility.

### Design
#### Modeling
I used Blender to model different unlockables in Tilt. In-game obstacles were mostly created within the Unity interface with the help of ProBuilder.

#### User Interface
I designed the UI in Tilt using the Unity UI editor and C# for functionality.

Some elements are designed in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.

### Monetization
Tilt uses the Unity Advertisements API in order to provide Banner Ads and Video Ads.

The monetization scheme mostly relies on Rewarded video Ads as well as in-app purchases.

## Screen captures
These screen captures have been recorded on a iPhone XS device.
